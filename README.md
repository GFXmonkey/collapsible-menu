Collapsible Menu
================

A simple, yet attractive sliding menu. With jQuery, the menu can slide, fade, grow, appear and allow only one instance expanded at a time, which is where the true beauty of this script lies. The original iteration of this script was created 2007. Since then, numerous scripts, made into jQuery plugins, have achieved the same result. I updated my old script with a more modern one, but do not plan on making it a jQuery plugin.
